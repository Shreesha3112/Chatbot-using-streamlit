3. Q&A bot must be built using a generative AI service such as OpenAI
4. Q&A bot should only respond to queries which are within the scope of your source documents
5. Build a simple web interface for this Q&A bot.

### 2. Q&A Bot should accurately respond to queries related to the contents of these files
