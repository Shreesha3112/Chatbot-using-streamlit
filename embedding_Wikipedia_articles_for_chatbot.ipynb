      "The Workflow Management Coalition, BPM.com and several other sources use the following definition:\n",
      "\n",
      ":: Business process management (BPM) is a discipline involving any combination of modeling, automation, execution, control, measurement and optimization of business activity flows, in support of enterprise goals, spanning systems, employees, customers and partners within and beyond the enterprise boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Association of Business Process Management Professionals defines BPM as:\n",
      "\n",
      ":: Business process management (BPM) is a disciplined approach to identify, design, execute, document, measure, monitor, and control both automated and non-automated business processes to achieve consistent, targeted results aligned with an organization’s strategic goals. BPM involves the deliberate, collaborative and increasingly technology-aided definition, improvement, innovation, and management of end-to-end business processes that drive business results, create value, and enable an organization to meet its business objectives with more agility. BPM enables an enterprise to align its business processes to its business strategy, leading to effective overall company performance through improvements of specific work activities either within a specific department, across the enterprise, or between organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Gartner]] defines business process management as:\n",
      ":: \"the discipline of managing processes (rather than tasks) as the means for improving business performance outcomes and operational agility. Processes span organizational boundaries, linking together people, information flows, systems, and other assets to create and deliver value to customers and constituents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is common to confuse BPM with a BPM suite (BPMS).   BPM is a professional discipline done by people, whereas a BPMS is a technological suite of tools designed to help the BPM professionals accomplish their goals.  BPM should also not be confused with an application or solution developed to support a particular process.  Suites and solutions represent ways of automating business processes, but automation is only one aspect of BPM.\n"
